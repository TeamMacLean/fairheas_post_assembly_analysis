## Introduction

The objective of this package are:

1) Remove signalp subsequence from a protein sequence. The position of signalp is in the protein sequence ID
2) The remaining  mature protein sequence is then mapped to an assembly of FASTA contig sequences using tblastn
3) The region in the reference sequence (which is the assembly file) that mapped exactly without any gaps to a protein sequence is extracted with 1000 bps from either side of the mapped region.
4) All extracted sequences are concatenated to a long sequence separated with a N.

## Requirements

1) rake
2) python
3) biopython
