## Introduction

The objective of this package are:

1) Remove signalp subsequence from a protein sequence. The position of signalp is in the protein sequence ID
2) The remaining  mature protein sequence is then mapped to an assembly of FASTA contig sequences using tblastn
3) The region in the reference sequence (which is the assembly file) that mapped exactly without any gaps to a protein sequence is extracted with 1000 bps from either side of the mapped region.
4) All extracted sequences are concatenated to a long sequence separated with a N.

## Requirements

1) rake
2) python
3) biopython

## Analysis Methods

The mapped region from reference sequence is extracted only if a protein sequence is mapped full length  without a gap. The subject sequence and positions of the first mapped region is output in a file that ends with full_length.txt

Protein sequences may also map 100% without gap in multiple regions/contigs of reference sequence. In that case, the subject sequence and positions of mapped regions are output in a file that ends with multiple.txt

Files ending with full_length.txt and multiple.txt have six columns in the order given below
Subjectid SubjectStartPosition SubjectEndPosition Queryid QueryStartPosition QueryEndPosition

Extracted mapped regions from reference sequence are concatenated to a super long sequence and saved in a file that ends with supersequence.fasta

Multiple hit regions are also extracted and saved as a separated fasta file ending with multiplehits.fasta
